Hello Everyone

I am Zorex from Python Philippines.

- First off I would like to congratulate the organizers for holding the PyCon this year in-person and happy 11th anniversary as well

- I'm here to talk about Music and a bit of the Taiwan and Philippine Culture, and how am I going to do that? using Python!


Disclaimer: I am no musician so I don't know about music theories and stuff, I only do this as a hobby.


but how?
`pip install musicpy`


I found a package that do what I want, play music and it is easy to dive into. I literally started playing with it last night when I'm cold, and alone in my hotel room last night.

This is how to use it:

`
from musicpy import C
`

C is a chord object that has this keyword arguments
C()
- chord name 
- octave
- duration



This is an informal invitation. We will be having PyCon Philippines 2024 sometime in February next year, if you want to visit the Philippines, you are welcome to join us.
